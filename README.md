My project involves a Gradient Generator developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to create gradients with different colors in various sections. It includes a special feature tailored for beginners, enabling them to choose their desired gradient colors. Additionally, the tool generates the corresponding CSS code for the selected gradient, along with the RGB color values (e.g., rgb(0,0,0)). Users can also enhance the visibility of their layout by adjusting the angle of the combined gradient colors.
